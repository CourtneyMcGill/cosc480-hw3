Feature: Filter products by age and price
  As the toy store manager,
  so that I can sell a variety of toys,
  I want to be able to add new toys to the toy store.

  Background: the toy story has several products
    Given these Products:
      | name         |    description | price | minage | maxage |
      | slinky       | shiny          |  3.49 |  2     |        |
      | fluffy bunny | mostly lovable | 17.50 |  0     |  3     |
      | ball         | rubbery        | 13.49 |  3     |  6     |
